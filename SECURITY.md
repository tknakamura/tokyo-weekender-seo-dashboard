## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files or expose sensitive configuration
2. **Database Credentials**: Use strong passwords and restrict database access
3. **API Keys**: Keep API keys secure and rotate them regularly
4. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries with SQLAlchemy
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
5. **Secrets Management**: Use environment variables for sensitive data

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- All keyword data is stored securely in NEON PostgreSQL
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Regular backups are maintained

### API Security

- CORS is configured to restrict origins
- Rate limiting should be implemented for production use
- Input validation on all API endpoints

### Infrastructure

- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
